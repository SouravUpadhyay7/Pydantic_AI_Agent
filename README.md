## üìå Overview
Pydantic_AI_Agent is a versatile AI agent framework that leverages type-safe data structures using Pydantic alongside state-of-the-art LLM APIs. The agent can be deployed either through Google Colab for quick experimentation or as a local Streamlit application for a more integrated experience.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
- **Python**: Core programming language
- **Pydantic**: Type validation and settings management
- **Groq API**: LLM service for natural language processing
- **Tavily API**: Search augmentation
- **Streamlit**: UI framework for the web application
- **Google Colab**: Hosted Jupyter notebook environment
## üöÄ Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Groq API key
- Tavily API key
### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/SouravUpadhyay7/Pydantic_AI_Agent.git
   cd Pydantic_AI_Agent
   ```
2. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Set up your environment variables:
   ```
   export GROQ_API_KEY="your_groq_api_key"
   export TAVILY_API_KEY="your_tavily_api_key"
   ```
## üñ•Ô∏è Usage
### Option 1: Run locally with Streamlit
```
streamlit run app.py
```
This will start a local server, typically at `http://localhost:8501`, where you can interact with the AI agent through a web interface.
### Option 2: Run in Google Colab
Open the `pydantic_ai_agent.ipynb` file in Google Colab and follow the instructions within the notebook. You'll need to provide your API keys in the designated cells.
